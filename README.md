# Trapezoidal-Rule
This C program uses the Trapezoidal Rule to approximate the integral of a given function.

Through the use of inter-process communication and more specifically parent to multi-child communication, this program approximates the integral of a given function. The program makes use of system calls such as fork()/pipe() to create the children and to communicate from parent to child and vice versa.
